What is this course? This course has provided me a broad introduction to
 machine learning datamining statistical pattern recognition.  Topics include:
 (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).  </description>
